In Hexagonal architecture, input ports (primary Adaptors) are interfaces that are implemented in the domain layer and used by clients of the domain layer

In Hexagonal architecture, output ports (Secondary Adaptors) are interfaces 
that are implemented in the infrastructure layer (data access, message modules)
and used by the domain layer to reach the infrastructure layers
